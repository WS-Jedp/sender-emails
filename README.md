# SENDING EMAILS WITH PYTHON

This is just a short code of how to send image from Python with Gmail.

### How Works
If for some reason you want to use this code you just need:
- Install the modules that we require so run `pip install`
- Once the modules are installed, you need to config you .env variables just like in the example file
- Lastly you have to specify to which emails you will send the message in the list on the sender.py file.
